        <h1>Moulin Rouge</h1>
        <p>One of the things I knew I wanted to see was the Moulin Rouge. A famous building in Paris, that has been featured in movies and is even the title of the 2001 hit movie.I went out on my own this night, without any connection to the internet and without knowing any French. I figured out my way there and got this photo.</p>
